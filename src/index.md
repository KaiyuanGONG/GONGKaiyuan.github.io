Engineer graduate from IMT Mines Alès, specialized in Artificial Intelligence and Computer Science.

Currently pursuing an M2 in LMFI (Master Logique Mathématique et Fondements de l'Informatique) at Université Paris Cité.

My interests include algorithms, formal methods and verification, and applications of AI to healthcare.

## Drafts

``` json {.paper}
"title": "SPECT4D: AI-enhanced Respiratory Motion Compensation for Liver SPECT",
  "authors": "Kaiyuan GONG",
  "venue": "Research Internship – CHU Nîmes",
  "year": "2025",
  "abstract": "This project focuses on improving respiratory-gated SPECT imaging for liver cancer dosimetry by leveraging deep learning and physics-informed reconstruction. Multiple data sources are integrated, including experimental physical phantom data, clinical patient data, synthetic phantoms, and simulated XCAT phantoms. The aim is to reduce motion-induced artifacts, improve signal-to-noise ratio, and decrease reconstruction times, enabling more accurate quantification for theranostics applications such as 177Lu-based radioligand therapy.",
  "methods": [
    "Respiratory signal extraction from list-mode projection data using center-of-mass tracking and low-pass filtering.",
    "Per-phase 3D SPECT reconstruction, deformable image registration (DVF-Net), and motion-compensated reconstruction with unrolled deep networks.",
    "Integration of physics priors (attenuation correction, collimator-detector response, scatter correction) and Poisson NLL loss for physics-consistent training.",
    "Data augmentation with synthetic and simulated phantoms (XCAT, SIMIND Monte Carlo) to improve model generalization."

  "data": [
    "Experimental phantom measurements (radioactive sphere with respiratory motion).",
